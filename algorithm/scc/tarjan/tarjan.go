In the mathematical theory of directed graphs,
a graph is said to be "strongly connected"
if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex.

A directed graph is called "strongly connected"
if there is a "path" in each direction
between each pair of vertices of the graph.

a pair of vertices u and v are said to be
strongly connected to each other
if there is a path in each direction between them.

binary relation of being strongly connected is an equivalence relation


"strongly connected components" of an arbitrary directed graph
form a partition into subgraphs that are themselves strongly connected.

"strongly connected component" of a directed graph G
is a subgraph that is strongly connected
, and is maximal with this property

SCC of G is a maximal set of vertices C in V
such that for all u, v âˆˆ C,
there is a path both from u to v and from v to u.
