// Tarjan finds the strongly connected components.
// In the mathematics, a directed graph is "strongly connected"
// if every vertex is reachable from every other node.
// Therefore, a graph is strongly connected if there is a path
// in each direction between each pair of node of a graph.
// Then a pair of vertices u and v is strongly connected to each other
// because there is a path in each direction.
// "Strongly connected components" of an arbitrary graph
// partition into sub-graphs that are themselves strongly connected.
// That is, "strongly connected component" of a directed graph
// is a sub-graph that is strongly connected.
// Formally, "Strongly connected components" of a graph is a maximal
// set of vertices C in G.V such that for all u, v âˆˆ C, there is a path
// both from u to v, and from v to u.
